# 🧠 Patent Guard – Innovation Registration System

## 📘 Project Description
Patent Guard is a **blockchain-based decentralized application** that allows innovators, inventors, and researchers to **securely register and verify ownership** of their ideas or innovations.  
Each innovation is recorded on the blockchain, providing **tamper-proof proof of existence and authorship**.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a **transparent, immutable, and trustless platform** for innovation registration and intellectual property protection, ensuring that every creator receives rightful recognition and ownership of their work.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Innovation Registration:**  
  Register new innovations with metadata and document hashes (e.g., IPFS CIDs).

- **Ownership Verification:**  
  Publicly verify who owns a specific innovation.

- **Ownership Transfer:**  
  Transfer innovation ownership in a secure and auditable way.

- **Decentralized Proof of Existence:**  
  Immutable records ensure that ownership and timestamps cannot be forged.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Integration with **IPFS or Arweave** for decentralized storage of documents.  
- Implementation of **Patent Review DAO** for community validation.  
- Integration with **NFT standards (ERC-721)** to represent innovations as digital assets.  
- **Cross-chain compatibility** for global innovation registration.  
- A **frontend DApp** for user-friendly interaction with the smart contract.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- Solidity (Smart Contracts)  
- Ethereum / EVM-compatible blockchain  
- Hardhat or Truffle for development and deployment  
- IPFS for decentralized storage (future scope)
